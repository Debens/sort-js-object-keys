# Sort JS Object Keys README

This is a VS code extension to alphabetically sort the keys in _selected_ js objects keys in your code.

## Reference

Referred the source code from [Rich Somerfield](https://github.com/richie5um)'s extension
[vscode-sort-json](https://github.com/richie5um/vscode-sort-json), his extension can only sort JSON, I added new feature base on his extension so this `sort*js*object*keys` extension can sort the JS object keys in source code.

## Usage

1. Select a js object in your source  
  Note: it uses full lines so ensure the selected lines are a valid js object, start from the "{" and end from the "}"
1. Run the extension command  
    * Sort JS object keys  
    Keybinding: `Alt+S`
    * Sort JS object keys (Reverse)
